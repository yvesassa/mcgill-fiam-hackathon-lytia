# McGill - FIAM Quantitative Asset Management Hackathon

📅 September–October 2024  
🏫 McGill University – Master of Management in Analytics  

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project was developed for the McGill–FIAM Quantitative Asset Management Hackathon. We built a machine learning-driven long-short equity strategy using XGBoost and financial Data. The model was trained on historical fundamental and alternative data to forecast stock returns and construct an optimized portfolio that significantly outperformed the S&P 500.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict monthly stock returns using a machine learning model.
- Construct and optimize a long-short portfolio using predicted returns.
- Benchmark against market indices over a 14-year period (2010–2024).

## 🧠 Methodology

- **Data Sources**: Historical financial data and alternative data
- **Preprocessing**: Feature engineering on temporal data and extraction from financial text.
- **Model**: XGBoost regression for return prediction.
- **Strategy**: Monthly rebalancing with top/bottom decile stock selection for long-short positioning.
- **Backtesting**: Evaluated on historical data with key risk and performance metrics.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- XGBoost
- Portfolio Optimization: Markowitz Framework
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Results

- **Annualized Return**: > 20%  
- **Total Return (2010–2024)**: **650%+**  
- **Sharpe Ratio**: **2.47**  
- **Max Drawdown**: Controlled within strategy thresholds  
- Outperformed the S&P 500 and baseline models
